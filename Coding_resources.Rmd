# Coding resources

Here is a list of resources that I found useful for learning a programming language or specific applications in that language.

## R

[Beckerman et al: Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists (2nd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-R-Introduction-Biologists/dp/0198787847)

[Wickham et al: R for Data Science](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/)

[Lee: Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io)

[Any material by Dr. Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io)

[Intro to R for use in Marine Microbiology](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/14lipZSQuCMKqCCCrjQbpIYEtPhch91L5): These are videos I created for a lab course at UCSB (EEMB 144L) for remote learning in 2020.

## Python

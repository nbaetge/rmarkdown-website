<div id="undergraduate-research" class="section level1">
<h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>
<p>This is an informal guide for undergraduates who are interested in
exploring science as a career option by getting involved and
contributing in laboratory research. This guide was initially crafted by
my friend and colleague <a
href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2OnvnAkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Dylan
Catlett</a> and I will continue to adapt it over time.</p>
<p>I encourage you to tap into your network and ask others, including
your professors and TAs, for additional information and advice.</p>
<div id="career-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2>Career trajectories</h2>
<p>There are many career paths in (environmental) science, including in
academia (i.e, universities, community colleges), government
organizations, policy and law, and in the private sector. If you’re
interested in any of these careers, seeking out research experience as
an undergraduate is a great way to expand your network and develop/hone
skills that translate across all of these paths, including soft skills,
critical thinking, writing and communication, and data generation,
analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>A graduate degree (MS, PhD) is not required to land a good job in
science, but it can help broaden your options. Most high-quality
graduate programs in scientific disciplines require minimal coursework
relative to an undergraduate degree and focus on practical research
experiences. Research experience is usually required to be admitted to
graduate school. Most who pursue graduate degrees in scientific
disciplines do not pay out of pocket for tuition and associated fees,
and receive a living wage and benefits (health insurance) while in
school.</p>
</div>
<div id="before-you-start" class="section level2">
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember, being “prodigy”, “genius”, or having a 4.0 GPA is not a
requirement for having a successful career in science or in
research.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherever you decide to start your career in science likely will
not be where your career in science ends.</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to know much about research before you get
involved! If you’re a 1st or 2nd year, you should have some evidence
that you’re interested in science (for example, by taking some classes).
If you’re a 3rd or 4th year, you should be close to declaring or
declared as a science major and have taken a decent number of science
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, everyone (you and your future research mentor) gets
more out of undergraduate research when the undergraduate student sticks
with it for a while. You should be pretty confident you want to give
this a shot for 6 months or more (summer opportunities can be shorter
term with a bigger time commitment per week).</p></li>
<li><p>Undergraduates often start out in research with menial tasks like
washing lab dishes, entering data into spreadsheets, etc. Expect to
spend your first 1-3 months in research doing mostly boring stuff. You
never fully get off the hook from the boring stuff, but you tend to have
to do less of it as you get more experience.</p></li>
<li><p>There are paid and volunteer research opportunities available.
The paid positions can be harder to come by, but there are likely
programs at your university that you can look into.</p></li>
<li><p>Every research experience is different. Some dive into lab bench
work, others focus on computational work, and some take to field work.
Asking the people you’re interested in working with about the day-to-day
is a good idea before you commit several months to an
opportunity.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="steps-to-get-into-a-lab" class="section level2">
<h2>Steps to get into a lab</h2>
<div id="prepare-a-curriculum-vitae" class="section level3">
<h3>Prepare a curriculum vitae</h3>
<ul>
<li>1-page. It’s ok at your career stage if you don’t have much on
there. Some things to include are your name and contact information,
work and/or volunteer experiences from high school and/or college, your
major and GPA, relevant coursework (this may change depending on who
you’re giving it to), any other qualifications or skills. <a
href="https://career.oregonstate.edu/careered/create-résumés-cvs-and-cover-letters">OSU’s
Career Development Center</a> is a great resource for guidance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="identify-programs-scholarships-research-programs-youre-interested-in"
class="section level3">
<h3>Identify programs, scholarships, research programs you’re interested
in</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Look through the faculty profiles on departmental webpages in the
field(s) you’re interested in (e.g., <a
href="https://microbiology.oregonstate.edu">Microbiology</a> or <a
href="https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/college-departments/agricultural-sciences/botany-plant-pathology/">Botany
and Plant Pathology</a>). Most faculty members have a lab website, so if
the brief description on the directory page sounds interesting, check
out their lab page for more information. If you don’t find a webpage on
the departmental site, try google-ing.</p></li>
<li><p>As you read through webpages, take note of the people working on
the topics that sound the most interesting to you. Note their email
addresses, if they have specific instructions for applying to work in
the lab, and what general topic(s) they work on that are interesting to
you.</p></li>
<li><p>Many funding opportunities for undergraduate research require you
to have a faculty sponsor, so when you talk with professors about
working in their lab, it can help your case to say that you want to try
for one of these.</p></li>

<div id="apply" class="section level3">
<h3>Apply</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Most structured scholarship or other paid research training
programs will have formal applications. Make sure to carefully read all
the guidelines and follow them. If they include a description of what
they are looking for in applicants, try to explicitly address those
(it’s ok to use their wording) in your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Some labs will have formal guidelines listed on their webpage for
applying to the lab. If so, follow the instructions carefully and make
sure you send them everything they ask for. Writing something into your
application/email/cover letter that shows you’ve read through their
website and maybe one of their scientific papers (whether or not you
understood any of it) is helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>If you find a lab you’re interested in and they have no
guidelines on how to apply/inquire about opportunities (this is
extremely common…), it’s time to start cold-emailing…</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="cold-emailing" class="section level3">
<h3>Cold-emailing</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many undergraduate research positions are initiated after an
undergraduate cold-emails a faculty member, grad student, or postdoc to
say they want to try research. It can feel scary but you don’t have to
be scared!</p></li>
<li><p>In your internet browsing above, you should try to identify 5-10
faculty whose research you’re interested in. Email all of them – there’s
an example cold email below to guide you.</p></li>
<li><p>You should expect at least 50% of the faculty you email not to
reply the first time. Give them 2-3 weeks and for those who don’t
respond, it’s totally normal and acceptable to send a brief follow-up
email to remind them (also an example below).</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a good chance ~50% won’t reply to the second email
either. Don’t take this personally, it’s just how it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Hopefully 1-3 faculty respond to your email, have an opening, and
want to set up a meeting (sometimes they’ll call it an interview) to
talk more with you. Respond promptly and professionally and make it as
easy as possible for them to schedule a meeting with you (example
below).</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re really interested in one lab group’s research but the
professor isn’t responding to your cold emails, you can also try
cold-emailing a graduate student or postdoc in their lab with the same
sort of approach. Grad students and postdocs can be more responsive than
their faculty advisors and are often the ones spending the most time in
training/mentoring undergraduate researchers.</p></li>

<p><font size="2"> Dear Dr. Baetge,</p>
<p>My name is Nick and I’m a 3rd year undergraduate student majoring in
Environmental Sciences with the aquatic biology option here at OSU. I’m
writing to ask if you have any openings for undergraduates to join your
lab as research assistants. I’ve been very interested in getting
involved in marine microbiology research since taking MB 230, an
introductory microbiology class at OSU. I found your webpage through the
Microbiolgy website and really enjoyed learning about your research on
coastal phytoplankton and bacteria. Although my interests are extremely
broad, I found your research involving the use of lab experiments and
satellite observations to study wildfire ash impacts on plankton
particularly interesting and I would be especially excited to apply my
background in biology to research focused on similar questions.</p>
<p>If you have any opportunities for undergraduate assistants to help in
your research, I would love to be considered. Please find my resume
attached and let me know if there is anything else I can do to be
considered for an undergraduate researcher position in your lab.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration,</p>

<p><font size="2"> Dear Dr. Baetge,</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up to make sure you received my message from a few
weeks ago (see below). I have re-attached my resume to this email just
in case. Please let me know if you have any openings for undergraduate
researchers to join your lab, and if so, if I can provide any further
information to improve my chances of being considered.</p>

Over the next few weeks I’m available (list some dates) at [list some

<h3>The meeting/interview</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Study for this. Do your best to read 1 or 2 of your prospective
research advisor’s scientific papers (the ones that interest you most!!)
and take notes and write down questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Be prepared with questions. Both about the science and about
logistics. How much am I expected to work? What will work look like? Is
there opportunity to be compensated for this work (or “are there any
scholarships I can apply for to be compensated for this work”)? Is there
opportunity to earn course credits? Do a senior thesis?</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be late. Show up to the meeting 5 minutes early if
anything.</p></li>
<li><p>You usually don’t need to dress up, but you probably don’t want
to show up in a bathing suit or run over straight from a workout
either.</p></li>
<li><p>Be yourself. Be honest about what you’re interested in (including
if you don’t know), and don’t try to act like you know what they’re
talking about if you don’t (you will probably get busted; it’s better to
just ask questions). Thank them for taking the time at the beginning and
end of the meeting and if they give you an opportunity to follow-up,
don’t miss it :)</p></li>

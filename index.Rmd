**Years ago, it occured to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving**

Someone who thinks on the run and runs to think. Though sometimes I run to escape thinking. I dig in and focus on the task at hand. I focus on trying to run faster, harder, smarter, and better. But I try to respect my limits because I'm only human. I also try to remember to have fun; else, what's the point? 

This running mentality transcends to other aspects of me, increasingly the part of me that is a scientist. Not being shy to new challenges and  wanting to have fun, but also having an amazing support network and some luck have all helped get me to where I am today: in the pursuit of a doctoral degree in the marine sciences **(expected 2021)**.

I've been learning from and working with [Dr. Craig Carlson and his lab](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/carlson/craig/), exploring the incessently fascinating world of marine microbes (read as: bacteria) and how they shape (and are shaped by) ocean biogeochemistry (read as: carbon cycling). I basically like to think about: 

- why microbes are so good at recycling and what happens when they're not
- whether they're initrinsically competitive or collaborative with one another
- how the carbon that microbes use (or don't) moves around the oceans
- how changes in microbially-mediated carbon flux might shift the way food webs and Earth's climate functions

Poke around to learn more about my research and **please, don't hesitate to contact me!**

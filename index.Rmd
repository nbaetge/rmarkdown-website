 <font size="5"> I am a scientist who studies microorganisms to understand their role in cycling carbon and energy through ocean ecosystems. </font>
 
 <font size="3"> To do my work, I conduct cultivation-dependent experiments in the lab, collect water samples from research cruises, and use autonomously-collected data like those from floats and satellites. </font>

<font size="3"> As a laboratory technician and then doctoral student in the [Carlson lab](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/carlson/craig/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I gained expertise in the recycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by bacterioplankton. 

I am now working as a postdoctoral scholar in the [Halsey](http://kim.halsey.co) and [Behrenfeld](https://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/) labs at Oregon State University. My current research goals are to: 

1. assess how the optical properties and cell physiology of phytoplankton change over the day-night cycle for a variety of cultured species.
2. investigate how day-night variability in the optical properties of phytoplankton impacts interpretations of satellite remote sensing data. </font>
